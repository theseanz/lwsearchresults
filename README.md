# Sean Stevens Search Results SPA - Search iTunes

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* `npm test` to run tests

Note: a browser window will open with both the `npm start` and `npm test` commands.

## Includes
1. Item Detail page. Can also go directly if you know an item id. Ex: `/#!/detail/299608205`
1. Different item templates (movie vs non-movie)
1. Landing page for search terms (`!#/home/[searchterm]`)
1. Responsive design
1. Some testing..this is not my area of expertise but I set up some unit tests on both controllers, including testing the service used to call iTunes.
